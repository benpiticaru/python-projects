# python-projects

The following projects are ones that I have been working on for the past few months.

Music Schedule is a program that takes a .csv or .tsv file from a google form that I created and produces a randomized schedule based on keep parameters, laid out
in the google form.

RNA_analysis_4.1 is a prelimary version of a program that I am working on that performs a comparative read length and poly-A length analysis of 2 sequenced long read RNA datasets.

Gradebook is a short bit of code that I wrote to help a professor I worked with. She was manually inputing student IDs and grades so I quickly wrote a program to do that
for her.

The other 2 programs are training modules from Linkedin Learn where I developed some of my programming in python skills and techniques.
